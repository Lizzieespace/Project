     <h1>Who is Salio?</h1><br>
     <p>SALIO hails from the Republic of Georgia, a place known to some for its
       harmonic scales and as the birthplace of wine, but not by most.
       A remarkably gifted vocalist and composer she decided to leave her home
        country and find her place in the wider world.</p>
     <p>Moving to London and working with Andrew Hunt provided her with the Lost
       World EP and him with a Music Producer's Guild Award for Breakthrough
       Producer of the Year.</p>
     <p>After notable performances at the Black Sea Jazz Festival and
     Springboard, Houston she was invited to record at the Dark Horse
     Institute, Nashville and Wire Road Studios, Houston.</p>
     <p>Bass player, Deon Estus, of Wham! fame and platinum selling jazz
       saxophonist, Dean James, started making arrangements to record with her.
        The natural beauty in her voice broke Dean's heart, literally. Just
        days later he was in hospital for a quadruple bypass operation.</p>
     <p> Tony Coluccio, a man who has worked with greats such as Bette Midler,
       Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson then asked her to record in New York
       City. Tied in with a quick secretive Sofar performance and a cameo at
       renowned Small's Jazz Club, it seems that no matter where she goes,
       those who appreciate true ability will find her.</p>
     <p>Having shared stages with the likes of Macy Gray and a recent video
       post with Joss Stone, it is only a matter of time before the rest of
       the world starts to recognise the magic that the girl from Georgia
       conjures wherever she may be.</p>
      <p>She is currently working with James Sanger on her debut album.</p>
