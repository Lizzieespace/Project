    <h1>Salio</h1>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Salio has been writing music since she was 9 years old. Hailing from Tbilisi, Georgia her family
        loved a good sing-song and she credits this as the start of her love for music. Learning the piano at an early age she wrote the song “Stars” or “Varsklavebj” at age 11.
        A few years later it became a massive hit in Georgia and is now more like a national anthem for both old and young alike.</strong></p><br>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Salio is a true Jazz girl, listening to Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Etta James, and Nina Simone.
        She absolutely loves their sounds and considers them her teachers. She loves singing with soul.</strong></p><br>

    <div>
      <p><strong>Life is the inspiration for Salio’s writing. She puts all her life experiences into her music.
        Her music is where she vents her sadness and her joy. Her song “He Flew Away” is her goodbye to her
        friend Giorgi who was stabbed at 13 years old. But her music also used for hope -recently she performed with her
        band in Georgia and was able to help raise money towards helping a young girl walk again in Tbilisi. </strong></p>

       <p>Moving to London and working with Andrew Hunt provided her with the Lost
        World EP and him with a Music Producer’s Guild Award for Breakthrough
        Producer of the Year.</p>
      <p>After notable performances at the Black Sea Jazz Festival and
        Springboard, Houston she was invited to record at the Dark Horse
        Institute, Nashville and Wire Road Studios, Houston.</p>
      <p>Bass player, Deon Estus, of Wham! fame and platinum selling jazz
        saxophonist, Dean James, started making arrangements to record with her.</p>
      <p> Tony Coluccio, a man who has worked with greats such as Bette Midler,
        Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson then asked her to record in New York
        City. Tied in with a quick secretive Sofar performance and a cameo at
        renowned Small’s Jazz Club, it seems that no matter where she goes,
        those who appreciate true ability will find her.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Having shared stages with the likes of Macy Gray and a recent video
        post with Joss Stone, it is only a matter of time before the rest of
        the world starts to recognise the magic that the girl from Georgia
        conjures wherever she may be.</p>
    <br>

      <p> <em> She is currently working with James Sanger on her debut album. </em></p>
